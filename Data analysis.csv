To add to the injury, you see others discussing new things they have learnt and the project they just completed when you are yet to start; It can cause setback and make you to feel like you are not doing well and that perhaps this is not your field.    Most of us started wrongly, with the mindset that there’s money in it. Let me dive in to make it. Those who introduced us to the field too almost ‘lied’ to us by telling us what we wanted to hear which is somehow far from the truth.  Most of the times, they will tell you that to become a data scientist, you don’t need to know mathematics like, it is just what you were taught in secondary schools. However, when you started, they told you that to go far you need to learn this and that. Statistical and probabilistic concepts that are new to you were introduced. Python you thought could be mastered within just one-month class is taking six months yet you are not sure of mastering it in the next six months. So, at this point, you felt they deceived or lured you into data science.
